# Predict-Customer-Clicked-Ads-Classification-by-Machine-Learning
## Overview
Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. For organizations overflowing with data but struggling to turn it into useful insights, machine learning can provide the solution to analyze and make data-driven recommendations and decisions. Businesses use machine learning to recognize patterns and then make predictions about what will appeal to customers, improve operations, or help make a product better. 

Classification is a machine learning algorithm of categorizing data into classes as labels or targets. By analyzing the input, the model learns how to classify new information and mapping labels or targets to the data. A use case of classification is often used in Banking, Financial Services, Insurance, etc. Finding fraud transactions and sophisticated classification algorithms is one of the business implementation on a real-time basis. 

In this paper we will predict the clicked ads customers using classification machine learning model.
## Summary
This project aims to predict the clicked ads customer based on customer profile and behavior to generate insights that lead to data driven business recommendation which objectives is to boost marketing campaign. This project implementing Classification supervised learning with Random forest model is chosen to predict clicked ads customers considering the higher precision and accuracy score. The results shows that Daily Internet Usage, Daily Time Spent on Site, Age and Area Income have high impact to predict the model. Based on these features, customers are classified into 2 class which are low class and high class customer. Simulation shows that machine learning implementation in predicting clicked ads customer able to prevent business to experiences potential loss and generate higher potential profit.
## Tools
Tools used in this project is Python as programming language and Google collaboratory as the tools.
## Dataset
The dataset is using marketing campaign dataset from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SM2mUQ1rnI-_NESibhDgn0asLfOYNTLm/view?usp=sharing).
